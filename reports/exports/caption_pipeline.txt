Overview of the end-to-end machine learning pipeline used to forecast black hole evolution. We extract most-bound-progenitor (MPB) tracks from IllustrisTNG100 across snapshots 18–33 and retain systems with ≥90% snapshot coverage (N≈2500). Tracks are standardized and split by subhalo ID into train/validation/test. An LSTM forecaster predicts future properties at horizons Δ={1,3,5} snapshots. Evaluation includes RMSE per horizon and feature, parity plots, baselines (persistence, ridge), and explainability analyses.
